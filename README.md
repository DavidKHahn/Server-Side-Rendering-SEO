### Server-Side-Rendering

#### CSR (Client Side Rendering): 
A client-side route happens when the route is handled internally by the JavaScript that is loaded on the page

**PROS**

 - Rich Interactions
 - Faster Response
 - Web Applications

**CONS**

 - Low SEO potential
 - Longer initial load

#### SSR (Server Side Rendering): 
While browsing, the adjustment of a URL can make a lot of things happen. This will happen regularly by clicking on a link, which in turn will request a new page from the server. This is what we call a server-side route. A whole new document is served to the user.


**PROS**

 - Static Sites
 - SEO
 - Initial Page Load

**CONS**

 - Full Page Reloads
 - Slower Page rendering
 - Requests to server


#### Next.js: 
 - Assists with less full page refresh for server side rendering using such features like Link (Note: With client side rendering you do not need to refresh the entire page but with server side rendering you do)
